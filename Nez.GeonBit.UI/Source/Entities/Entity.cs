#region File Description

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Base UI entity. Every widget inherit from this class.
// The base entity implement the following key functionality:
// 1. Drawing basic stuff like tiled textures with frames etc.
// 2. Positioning and calculating destination rect.
// 3. Basic events.
// 4. Visibility / Disabled / Locked modes.
// 5. Managing child entities.
